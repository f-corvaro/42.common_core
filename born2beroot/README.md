  ## 0 - Introduction
  
  <p align="justify">
    
 Born2beRoot is an introduction to virtualization and system administration. The purpose is to create a virtual machine which is a server implementing strict rules, and minimum required services.
    
  </p>

## 1 - Download the virtual machine ISO

  <p align="justify">
    
  [Debian ISO url](https://www.debian.org/download.en.html). I have chosen debian because is highly recommended in the subject.

  </p>
  
  ## 2 - Installing the VM (virtual machine)
  
<p align="justify">
  
In this tutorial we will use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

  1 | Open VirtualBox and click ```New```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/1.png">

2 | Choose a name for the machine and the folder which will locate it. 
	
**IMPORTANT:** Store the machine created inside the goinfre folder located in your cluster server. This will avoid the run out of memory space in your session and avoid that the installation will fail. (Ask your staff if you can't find it). Then click ```continue```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/2.png">

3 | Select the total RAM memory which we will reserve for the machine.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/3.png">

4 | Select the second option - ```create a virtual hard disk now```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/4.png">

5 | Choose ```VDI``` option (we downloaded an ISO).

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/5.png">

6 | Select the ```Dynamically allocated``` option, it will allocate the memory of the physical machine as it feels necessary while using the virtual machine until we reach the available limit.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/6.png">

7 | Set ```30 GB```, because we are doing the bonus.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/7.png">

8 | Click on ```Settings```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/8.png">

9 | Now click on ```Storage``` , again click on ```ðŸ’¿ Empty```. Click the ```ðŸ’¿``` in the line of "optical drive" and click ```Choose a disk file```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/9.png">

10 | Select the ISO that we just downloaded and click ```Open```, then click on ```Ok```. 

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/10.png">

11 | Once all this steps have been completed we can ```Start``` our new virtual machine from VirtualBox.
  
</p>

## 3 - Installing Debian

<p align="justify">
  
Choose your scale rate to get window bigger or smaller: (I prefer 300%)

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/11.png">

The ```cmd``` key on your keyboard will help you to switch the capture of your mouse from vm to your system or viceversa.
  
**WARNING:** when you will switch from one to another, pay attention to change uppercase to lowercase or viceversa. This could be a common mistake that you wuold do and you would have problem with the input of the password, because the vm will remain at the old choice.

1 | We will choose the version without graphic interface ```Install``` (is a mandatory part of the subject). 
 
  To confirm something is used ```Enter key```.
  
  The ```Arrow keys``` are used to move around.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/12.png">

2 | Choose the language. Select ```English```.  

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/13.png">

3 | Select the country. If yours there isn't in the list, go to ```other```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/14.png">

4 | Select your location (for me is Italy).

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/15.png">

5 | Select the configure locales, choose ```United States```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/16.png">

6 | Select your keymap, I will choose ```American English```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/17.png">

7 | Set a ```Host Name``` of the machine, must be your login followed by a 42.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/18.png">

8 | The ```Domain name``` must be blank until the subject will require it (see the version of the subject).

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/19.png">

9 | Go to *Show Password in Clear* and then press the ```Space bar```. Now set a strong password policy for the root user. **Save this password, will be useful**. Then you need to repeat the password to set.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/20.png">

10 | Set up the username. As is wrote in the subject, write your student login name. Then repeat

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/21.png">

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/22.png">
  
11 | Set our new user password. I will use the same password. Just as before, you need to repeat the process.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/23.png">

12 | Select ```Manual```. (Is required part for the bonus, so we can edit the partitions one by one)

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/24.png">

13 | It shows us a general description of our memory partitions and mount points. Currently, I don't have any partitions. To create a new partition, we must choose the disk where we want to create them. In our case, we will choose the only one available.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/25.png">

14 |  Accept the confirmation message. Basically, it warns us that if there are already partitions on the device, they will be deleted and if we are sure to create a new empty partition.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/26.png">

15 | Appears our partition table that is empty. Now we must configure it, for this we must select ```pri/log  32.2  GB FREE SPACE```

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/27.png">
  
16 | Create a new partition.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/28.png">
  
17 | I start with sda1, as the subject indicates, the size of the partition must be 500 megabytes.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/29.png">
  
18 | Choose the type of partition. We choose primary because it will be the partition where the operating system will be installed.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/30.png">
  
** Brief description of all types of partitions:**

â—¦ **Primary:** The only partition on which an OS can be installed. There can only be 4 primary partitions per hard drive or 3 primary and one extended.

â—¦ **Extended:** It was designed to break the 4 primary partition limitation on a single physical disk. An HDD may contain only one extended partition, but that extended partition can be subdivided into multiple logical partitions. It's used to contain logical partitions.

â—¦ **Logical:** It occupies a portion of the primary/extended partition or the whole of it, which has been formatted with a specific type of file system (in our case we will use ext4) and has been assigned a unit, so the operating system recognizes the logical partitions or its file system. There can be a maximum of 23 logical partitions in an extended partition, however, Linux (the OS we are currently working with), reduces it to 15, more than enough for this project.  
  
19 |   Select ```Beginning``` because we want that the new partition will be created at the beginning of the available space.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/31.png">

20 |  It shows the details of the partition. We will modify the mount point as specified in the subject.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/32.png">
  
Choose ```/boot```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/33.png">

Finish configuring the current partition.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/34.png">
  
21 | Completed the previous step, the partition should already appear. Now we must create a logical partition with all the available space on the disk, which has no mount point and is encrypted. To do this, select the free space where we want to create it.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/35.png">
  
22 | Create a new partition.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/36.png">
  
Select the maximum size.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/37.png">
  
Select the type of partition, logical in this case.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/38.png">

Modify the mount point.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/39.png">
  
Choose the option ```Do not mount it```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/40.png">
  
Finish configuring the current partition.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/41.png">
  
23 | Configure encrypted volumes, so we can encrypt our partition.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/42.png">
  
Accept the confirmation message.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/43.png">
  
Create the encrypted volumes.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/44.png">
  
Select which partition we want to encrypt.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/45.png">
  
Finish configuring the current partition.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/46.png">
  
```Finish``` because we don't want to create more encrypted volumes.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/47.png">

Accept the confirmation message. It tells us that everything inside the partition will be encrypted and it should not take long to finish.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/48.png">
  
```cancel``` it because there is nothing to encrypt (the partition is empty).
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/49.png">
  
Enter a password, this time it will be the encryption phrase.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/50.png">
  
24 | ```Configure the logical volume manager```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/51.png">
  
Accept the confirmation message as we agree to save the changes to the disk.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/52.png">

```Create a new volume group```. 
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/53.png">
  
Enter the name we want to give it: ```LVMGroup``` as indicated in the subject.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/54.png">
  
Select the partition where we want to create the group: ```sda5_crypt```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/55.png">
  
Create all the logical partitions as we requested from the subject. 

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/b.png">

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/56.png">
  
Choose the group where we want to create the logical partitions. We select the only one available (the one we created).

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/57.png">
  
The order of creation of the logical units must be the same of the subject, so we will start with ```root``` and end with ```var-log```. 
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/58.png">
  
Size, as indicated in the subject, will be ```10g```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/59.png">
  
Repeat the process for all the seven logical volumes. Then continue with finish.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/60.png">
  
25 | Now we can see all our partitions and free space, all the logical partitions that we just created are already appearing. We must configure the mount point and the usage of these. Again we will go in order and select the first one that appears, which is ```home```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/61.png">
  
We can see the configuration of the partitions. We must choose a file system as it currently does not have one.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/62.png">

Choose the ```Ext4 file system``` in use as option, it is the most commonly used file system in Linux distributions.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/63.png">
  
Then select the mount point as home.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/64.png">

And the first one is gone.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/65.png">
  
Now we need to repeat, to see what mount point I use and the use as, watch the image below that resume the final result:

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/66.png">

Accept the message and the changes will be saved. Make sure that all of the partitions look the same as in the screenshot.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/67.png">

Select the option ```No``` because we don't need additional packages.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/68.png">
  
Choose your Country.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/69.png">
  
Choose ```deb.debian.org```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/70.png">

Leave this option empty and click ```Continue```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/71.png">
  
 We selected the option ```No``` because we do not want that developers watch our statistics even though they are anonymous.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/72.png">

Remove all the software options using the spacebar and press ```Continue```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/73.png">
  
Select ```Yes``` to install  [GRUB](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_GRUB) boot in the primary drive.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/74.png">
  
Choose the device for the bootloader installation ```/dev/sda```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/75.png">
  
Press ```Continue``` to finish the installation.

</p>

## 4- VM setup 

<p align="justify">

### Boot - When the system boot 
  
  -> Select ```Debian GNU/Linux```.

### Boot - The system will require the password of the encrypted disk 
  
-> Write the encryptation password that previously we set. For me is ```Pw.20STNG!81```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/77.png">

### Boot - The system will require the user and password that we created 
  
-> In my case the user is ```fcorvaro``` and the password is ```Pw.20STNG!81```.
  
<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/78.png">

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/79.png">
  
### 1 - Installing sudo & configuration of user and groups 

1 | The beginning of the installation starts with changing user to root so we can install sudo. For doing this write ```su -``` in the bash prompt and introduce the root password (for me ```Pw.20STNG!81```). Furthermore we will install [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) to configure some files. 
Write the command 
  
```
$>apt-get update
$>apt-get install vim
$>apt install sudo
```

Verify whether _sudo_ was successfully installed via:

```
$>dpkg -l | grep sudo
```

2 | Adding User to _sudo_ Group

```
$>adduser <username> sudo
```

Alternatively, add user to sudo group via:

	$>usermod -aG sudo <username>

Verify whether user was successfully added to sudo group via:

	$>getent group sudo

`sudo reboot` for changes to take effect, then log in and verify sudopowers via `sudo -v`.

3 | Running root-privilege commands 

Run root-privileged command via prefix ```sudo```.

### 4.1 -   Installing & configuring SSH

SSH stands for "Secure Shell." The SSH protocol was designed as a secure alternative to unsecured remote shell protocols. It utilizes a client-server paradigm, in which clients and servers communicate via a secure channel.

1 | Update the system using ```sudo apt update```.

2 | Install the main tool for remote access with the SSH protocol, using OpenSSH. The packagerequired:

```sudo apt install openssh-server``` 

Confirm writing ```y```, and wait for the installation time.

```sudo service ssh status``` to check if the package was succesfully installed. **Active** is required to continue.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/80.png">

3 | Edit the file ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```. If you are not on root you will not be able to edit the file; as you know, for switching to root we use ```su```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/81.png">

4 | The ```#``` means that line it is commented. The lines that we will be edit have to be uncommented. Once we are editing the file we need to update the following lines:

+ ```#Port 22 -> Port 4242```

* ```#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin no```

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/82.png">

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/83.png">

Save the changes and leave the file.

5 | With the file ```/etc/ssh/ssh_config``` (not ```sshd_config```) we will do the same we do early. Edit the following line: 

+ ```#Port 22 -> Port 4242```

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/84.png">

6 | Restart the ssh service so it can be updated. Use ```sudo service ssh restart``` and once it is done we will check the service state with ```sudo service ssh status``` and confirm that everything is alright.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/85.png">

### 4.2 - Installing & configuring UFW 

[UFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) is a [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)) which use the command line for setting up [iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) using a small number of easy commands.

1 | Install the packages for UFW: ```sudo apt install ufw```and type ```y``` when is requested. The installation will proceed

2 | Start the UFW using the command ```sudo ufw enable``` and then it have to show us the *firewall is active.*

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/86.png">

3 | We must allow our firewall to accept the connections (that will happens in the 4242 port). Use ```sudo ufw allow 4242```. 

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/87.png">

4 | For checking if everything done is correct, we need to check the actual state of our firewall. Use ```sudo ufw status```.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/88.png">

### 4.3 - Setting up the sudo policies 

1 | Create a file in ```/etc/sudoerd.d/```. The file will serve the purpouse of storing our sudo policy. Use: ```sudo touch /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config```.

2 | We must create a directory, as is asked in the subject, in ```/var/log/``` because each commands need to be logged, the input and output. Use ```sudo mkdir /var/log/sudo```.

3 | Edit the file that we created in the first step of this section. Use ```sudo vim /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config```.

4 | Write into the file the following lines:

```
Defaults  passwd_tries=3
Defaults  badpass_message="Mensaje de error personalizado"
Defaults  logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo_config"
Defaults  log_input, log_output
Defaults  iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo"
Defaults  requiretty

```

As it should be:

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/89.png">

+ passwd_tries -> Total tries for entering the sudo password.

* badpass_message -> The message that will show when the password failed, can be customized.

* logfile	-> Path where will the sudo logs will be stored.

* log_input, log_output, iolog_dir  -> What will be logged.

* requiretty  -> [TTY](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=t-tty-command) is required .

- secure_path	-> Folders that will be excluded of sudo
	
### 4.4 Setting up a strong password policy 

1 | Edit the login.defs file.

```sudo vim /etc/login.defs```

2 | Edit the file, set the parameters:

+ PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 -> PASS_MAX_DAYS 30

* PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 -> PASS_MIN_DAYS 2

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/90.png">

* PASS_MAX_DAYS: It's the max days till password expiration.

* PASS_MIN_DAYS: It's the min days till password change.

- PASS_WARN_AGE: It's the days till password warning.

3 | Install the package ```sudo apt install libpam-pwquality``` , then write ```Y``` when is required. Wait till it finish.

4 | Edit the file using ```sudo vim /etc/pam.d/common-password```. 

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/91.png">

5 | Immediately after ```retry=3```, add (in the same line) the commands:

```
minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 lcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root
```

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/92.png">

+ minlen=10 -> The minimun characters a password must contain.

**- sign, that's refering to minumum caracters. + sign it refer to maximum characters.**
	
* ucredit=-1 -> The password at least have to contain a capital letter. 
	
* dcredit=-1 -> The password at least have to containt a digit.

* lcredit=-1 -> The password at least have to contain a lowercase letter.

* maxrepeat=3 -> The password can not have the same character repited three contiusly times.

* reject_username -> The password can not contain the username inside itself.

* difok=7 -> The password it have to containt at least seven diferent characters from the last password used. 

- enforce_for_root -> We will implement this password policy to root.

### 4.5 Connecting via SSH

1 | To connect via SSH we must close the machine and go to settings.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/93.png">

2 | Click on ```Network```, click on ```Advanced``` so it shows more options, then we click on ```Port fowarding```.

3 | Click on the emoji for adding a new rule.

4 | Add the ```4242``` port to Host and Guest. The IP's are not required. Click accept so changes are saved.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/94.png">

-> To connect via ssh from the machine to the vm use the command ```ssh <user>@localhost -p 4242```. It will ask for the password of the user that we are trying to log in. Once the password is introduced it will show login in different colour, that will mean that the connections has been successfully.

## 5 - Script_System_Info

You need to pay attention to all things in this section. You will be asked how the script works during the evaluation.

A **script** is a sequence of commands stored in a file that when executed will do the commands writed.

### 5.1 - Architecture

To show the architecture of the OS, you can use the command ```uname -a``` ("-a" == "--all"). This command print information about the current machine and the OS running on it, except the hardware information and the CPU. ```uname -a``` print all available system information.

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/96.png">
  
### 5.2 - Physical Cores

To show the number of physical cores use the file ```/proc/cpuinfo```, which give us information about the CPU: its type, brand, model, performance, etc. We will use ```grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l``` with the command ```grep``` we are searching and matching into the file "physical id". With ```wc -l``` to count the line of the grep output. 

<img width="650" src="https://github.com/f-corvaro/42.common_core/blob/main/born2beroot/screenshots/97.png">

### 5.3 - Virtual Cores

To show the number of virtual cores we use the file ```/proc/cpuinfo```, but in this case we will use the command ```grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l```. The usage is same as before instead of counting the lines of "physical id" we will do it with "processor". We do it this way for the same reason as before, the way of quantifying marks 0 if there is a processor.

### 5.4 - RAM

To show the RAM memory use the command ```free``` to see at the moment information about the RAM (the amount used, the amount available, the amount reserved for other resources, etc). For more info use the command ```free --help```. We will use ```free --mega``` since that unit of measure appears in the subject.
	
We must filter our search because we do not need all the information that it provides. The first thing we need to show is the used memory, using the ```awk``` command, which processes data based on text files,  we can use the data that interests us from a file. We compare if the first word of a row is equal to "Mem:" we will print the third word of that row, which will be the used memory. The whole command together would be ```free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}'```. In the script the return value of this command will be assigned to a variable that will be concatenated with other variables so that everything is the same as specified in the subject.

To obtain the total memory, we change the third one with the second one.
```free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}'```.

For calculate the % of used memory. The differences between the code we wrote before and this one is the printing part. We are using ```%.2f``` so that only 2 decimals are shown. In printf to show a ```%``` you have to put ```%%```. The whole command ```free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("(%.2f%%)\n", $3/$2*100)}'```.

### 5.5 - Disk memory
	
To view the occupied and available memory of the disk, we will use the ```df``` command ("disk filesystem"), it is used to get a complete summary of the use of disk space. As indicated in the subject, the used memory is shown in MB. We use the -m flag. Next, we will do a grep to only show us the lines that contain "/dev/" and then we will do another grep with the -v flag to exclude lines that contain "/boot". Finally, we will use the awk command and sum the value of the third word of each line to once all the lines are summed, print the final result of the sum. 
```df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{memory_use += $3} END {print memory_use}'```.

To obtain the total space, the only differences will be that the values we will sum will be $2 instead of $3 and the other difference is that in the subject the total size appears in Gb, so as the result of the sum gives us the number in Mb we must transform it to Gb, for this we must divide the number by 1024 and remove the decimals.
```df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{memory_result += $2} END {printf ("%.0fGb\n"), memory_result/1024)}'```.

We must show a percentage of the used memory. We combine the two previous commands to have two variables, one represents the used memory and the other the total. The operation to obtain the percentage is: ```use/total*100``` and the result of this operation will be printed as it appears in the subject, between parentheses and with the % symbol at the end.
```df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{use += $3} {total += $2} END {printf("(%d%%)\n"), use/total*100}'```.

### 5.6 - CPU usage percentage

To view the percentage of CPU usage, we will use the ```vmstat``` command, which shows system statistics, allowing us to obtain a general detail of the processes, memory usage, CPU activity, system status, etc. We could put no option but I will put an interval of seconds from 1 to 3. We will also use the ```tail -1``` command, which will allow us to produce the output only on the last line, so of the 3 generated, only the last one will be printed. We will only print word 15, which is the available memory usage. The entire command is as follows: ```vmstat 1 3| tail -1 | awk '{print$15}'```. 
The result of this command is only part of the final result since there is still some operation to be done in the script for it to be correct. What should be done is to subtract the amount returned by our command from 100, the result of this operation will be printed with one decimal and a % at the end and the operation would be finished.

### 5.7 - Last reboot

To see the date and time of our last reboot, we will use the ```who``` command with the ```-b``` flag, as this flag will display the time of the last system boot on the screen. It shows us more information than we want, so we will filter it and only show what we are interested in, for this we will use the awk command and compare if the first word of a line is "system", the third word of that line will be printed on the screen, a space, and the fourth word. ```who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}'```.

### 5.8 - LVM activation

To check if LVM is active or not, we will use the ```lsblk``` command, which shows us information about all block devices (hard drives, SSDs, memories, etc) among all the information it provides. This command will print Yes or No. Basically, the condition we are looking for will be to count the number of lines in which "lvm" appears and if there are more than 0 we will print Yes, if there are 0 we will print No. ```if [ $(lsblk | grep "lvm" | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then echo yes; else echo no; fi```.
